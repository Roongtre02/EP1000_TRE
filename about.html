					<h1>Hi, I'm Roong Er</h1>
					<p>I'm currently a Year 3 Singapore Polytechnic Student studying Diploma in Interior Design.</p>
					<p>I am a person who enjoy learning new knowledge that I found interesting in. Sketching, designing and photographing is what I am passionate about, but acquire new skills and step out of my comfort zone is what my MBTI - adventurous is meant to be.

					<p>I have always wanted to try learning coding and design things that are in need in daily lifes. Hence, EP1000: Digital Fabrication and Prototyping Fundamentals is my very first elective option. I hope at the end of this elective course, I could learn the takeaways that I've never experience before.</p>
					<p>I like to work with jazz background music on, it helps me to stay focus on my work and get it done fast. As an Interior Design Student, I also work part time at my intern company. My ideas often floats up while exploring the National Art Musuem, scrolling pinterest or from the nature environment. (ps: I'm an athlete doing archery as my sport and is a competitive archer and Vice Pres in the club) I'm busy as always, trying to survive from the lack of time...
